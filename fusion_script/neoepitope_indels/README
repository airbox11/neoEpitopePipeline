# This script is to do neoepitope prediction based on indel vcf result
# Input are
# Indel vcf 
# The expected length of peptide
# PHLAT HLA results (after convertion)


> sh main_indels.sh 
Usage: main_indels.sh -f indelsFile -l lenAA -a format_hla_phlat -o outputDir
	-f: Path to indels file generating from ODCF pipeline
	-l: Length of predicted neopeptides # e.g. 29 
	-a: Path to file containing HLA class I and DRB allele
	-o: Path to output folder # must be empty
>>>> Note: Absolute path be required
