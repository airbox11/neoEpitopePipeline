# This script depends on tool netchop. Make sure it runs successfully based on the tutorial netchop.
# This script is to visualize the neoepitope prediction results including MHC-I and MHC-II

> Rscript run_visualization_neoepitope_prediction.R 

    Required three arguments:
    arg1: Path to MHC-I prediction result file
    arg2: Path to MHC-II prediction result file
    arg3: Path to your output file
	
Example:
Rscript run_visualization_neoepitope_prediction.R classI_file classII_file output_file


## For indel neoepitope visualization, it is embedded in the neoepitope_indels folder script
## For fusion-based neoepitope visualization, it is also embedded in the fusion folder script
