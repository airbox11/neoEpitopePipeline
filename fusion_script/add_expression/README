## This pipeline is to add gene expression to target genes.
# It could be from TCGA database or from RNA-seq BAM.
# If RNA-seq data is available, mutant allele could be caculated and added. Using main_add_RNA.sh
# If RNA-seq data is not available, using run_add_refExpression.R


> sh main_add_RNA.sh 
Usage: main_add_RNA.sh -p pipelineFolder -v vcf -b BAM -e expressionProfiling -n neoepitopeResult -o outputDir
    -p: Path to pipeline folder
    -v: Path to VCF file (snvs)
    -b: Path to RNA bam file
    -e: Path to RNA-seq expression file (TPM, FPKM)
    -n: Path to neoepitope prediction result file
    -o: Path to your output file

>>> Note: Absolute path needed

> Rscript run_add_refExpression.R 

	Required three arguments:
	arg1: Path to TCGA expression file
	arg2: Path to neoepitope prediction file
	arg3: Path to your output file

	Example:
	Rscript run_add_refExpression.R /to/your/TCGA-BRCA/TCGA-BRCA_expression_addName.tab /to/your/results_HB60_MHCI_epitopes_filtered.tab /to/my/results_HB60_MHCI_epitopes_filtered_TCGA-BRCA.tab
