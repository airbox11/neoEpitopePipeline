## This script takes fusion.tsv (from Sebestian Uhrig) as input
# To generate a new file my_modified_fusion.tsv, which add rwo number as ID
# To generate a new folder "fusionPepDir" which contains individual file including fusion peptide
# To calculate recurrent fusion, result file "recurrent_fusion.pdf"
Rscript generate_fusion_peptide_fasta.R

# This script is to do HLA typing based on BAM file
# First, convert the BAM file to fastq file
# Then, do HLA typing using PHLAT tool
# 
# Using the following command to generate command for hla typing with PHLAT
> sh main.sh 
Usage: main.sh -i PID 
    -i: sample ID
